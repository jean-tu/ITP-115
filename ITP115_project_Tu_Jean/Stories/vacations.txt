A vacation is when you take a trip to some _place_ with your family.
Usually you go to some palace that is near a _n_ or up on a _n_.
A good vacation place is one where you can ride a _n_ or play _v_ or go hunting for _n_.
I like to spend my time running. When parents go on vacation, they spend their time eating three _n_.
